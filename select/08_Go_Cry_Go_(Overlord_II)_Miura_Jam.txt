Go Cry go!

Now Well
We need through this
Now the world is totally unclear
Here is no truth left in a total overkill
It's like a party and everybody's lost their god-damned minds
Until we break
We're stuck in our place
Imprisoned by decisions, but I feel myself rising

What can night bring?
What is it you ask for?
None will answer
None at all
This moment just won't seem to
DISAPPEAR!!

It's time to break out (break out)
Get out of here
Cry out (cry out)
Plotting our escape
Pushing forward
Now we gotta play go (play go)
Watching the world
Cry out (cry out)
While we make our break
You can't hold back now!

So we gonna dance
Go crazy, crazy and dance
Just go crazy now
Dance dance, crazy, crazy and dance
Is it just a dream? Or hell?
Go cry go!

Hey, are you kidding?
If the truth is what you're chasing for!
You'll lose yourself inside of the haze
The Hunter is the prey this time so you got to be hunted!
Who is lying?
What is it you ask for?
Here's the winner
Just ask them
Only the winner has the answer we need!

Everything break up (break up)
Destroy it all!
Burn up (Burn up)
Echo of the voice, that you're hearing
We got the break up, break up what is unclear
Burn up, burn up for what lies ahead
Even if there is no hope!

Maybe I know that I can never reach
The stars above that light this dark sky
Ah, can't stop until we're free
I'll reach with both my hands
Embrace this hopelessness and carry on!

It's time to break out (break out)
Get out of here
Cry out (Cry out)
Plotting our escape
Pushing forward
Now we gotta play go (play go)
Watching the world
Cry out (Cry out)
While we make our break
You can't hold back now!

So we gonna dance-
Go crazy, crazy and dance
Just go crazy now
Dance dance, crazy, crazy and dance
Is it just a dream? Or hell?
Go cry go
