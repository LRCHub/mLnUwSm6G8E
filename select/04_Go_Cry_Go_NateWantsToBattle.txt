Go Cry Go!

Are we really truthless?
You know this world is fading, so useless
Here there is no truth left
Yeah, we kill, we steal, we're remorseless
It's like a party
We dance into the night in each other's way
So keep moving on until you run out
Will you be winners or be losers
Or you simply falling victim

Tell me, what can I believe?
Questions plaguing my mind
Still no one answers
All I know has vanished straight into the
The endless void

We gotta
Break out! Break out!
Keep moving on
Cry out! Cry out!
Hold your head up high
Don't you stand down
We gotta
Break out! Break out!
Out of this world
Cry out! Cry out!
Cut your way right through
Don't you lose your way

So we gotta just go crazy, crazy and mad
Just go crazy now
Dance, dance crazy, crazy and mad
Hell or an illusion, gotta go
Go Cry Go!
